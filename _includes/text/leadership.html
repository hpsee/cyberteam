The Northeast Cyberteam is a collaborative effort by led by the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC), University of Maine, University of New Hampshire, and University of Vermont, with support from the University of Massachusetts system and Worcester Polytechnic Institute. The program is modeled after other regional collaborations that have emerged since the opening of MGHPCC, a consortium created in 2013 by Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston University, Northeastern University and the University of Massachusetts system to build a high-performance data center that now houses the largest aggregation of research computing power in the Northeast.
