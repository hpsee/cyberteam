The Northeast Cyberteam Program is a 3-year initiative funded by the National Science Foundation to build a regional pool of Research Computing Facilitators to support researchers at small and mid-sized institutions in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont, leveraging the work of national programs including XSEDE Campus Champions, ACI-REF and others. Research Computing Facilitators (RCFs) are experts at figuring out how to match the right compute resources to the task at hand, something that can stymie researchers who are, for example, sifting through billions of records to find a specific pattern of genes that correlates with a particular form of cancer; or examining massive quantities of sensor data to understand movements on the sea floor. The RCF’s job is to help make use of local, regional, and national high performance computing resources when computing needs exceed the capacity of the scientist’s desktop. RCFs can often be found in the research computing groups at large universities and corporations, but are scarce at smaller institutions. Recognizing that promising research can be stopped in its tracks without high performance computing when the need arises, the Northeast Cyberteam Program was created to fill the gap. Over the next three years, the program will support 42 compute-intensive projects with RCFs-in-training ("students"), each paired with a mentor, to facilitate research computing needs for a 3 month period. RCF students will also have the opportunity to work on a live help desk with a mentor, honing their consultative skills while getting exposure to a broad range of research computing topics. As part of the program, RCF students will become part of a community of facilitators that has up-to-the-minute visibility into research computing projects and programs taking place in the region. Stipends ranging from $3000-$6000 are available for students participating in the program.
