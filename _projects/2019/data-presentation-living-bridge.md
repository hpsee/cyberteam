The Memorial Bridge between Kittery, ME and Portsmouth, NH has several sensors on and below that collect data and record that data in an on-bridge database in a raw form. This project is extracting data from the on-bridge database into a new researcher-facing database that will offer publicly-available dataset extractions and on-server calculations for those researchers who wish to understand the work being done on the Living Bridge.
