Meteorological observations across North America and Europe suggest a significant increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather (heat waves, cold waves, precipitation events) coincident with satellite-measured major decline of Arctic sea ice over the past decade. This project will assess the occurrence and impact of extreme weather events across Northern New England using both station data and climate reanalysis models. Weather and climate are critically important across Northeast New England, owing to the heavy reliance of natural resources for its economy. In particular this project involves mining multi-terabyte databases and model outputs to visualize data in a variety of formats.
