This project is designed to help prepare an interdisciplinary course in flow modelling, particularly smooth particle hydrodynamics. The project consists of creating a series of tutorial videos and sample programs for how to get started with the computational environment and the basics of flow modelling. This material will be used in an anticipated interdisciplinary course in the Fall of 2019.
