Li-Jun Ma at UMass Amherst uses high-throughput sequencing that relies on HPC. We have been adapting her PacBIO SMRTAnalysis pipelines to run in a cluster environment. We are working extensively with PacBIO vendor support, and with the Ask.CI and XSEDE Campus Champions communities to tackle this project. Ask.CI has proved very useful and allowed us to progress farther with one of the pieces of software for Li-jun.
