Students will be solely responsible for the design, construction, configuration, and maintenance of a recommissioned collection of used computing hardware to craft a basic HPC cluster. The experiment will offer students practical experience in the administration and use of a HPC cluster, something not typically made available in the regular curriculum. Additionally, this project will serve as a potential cookbook to encourage other small and medium-sized institutions to reconsider scrapping old computing hardware for the purpose of teaching students HPC on a shoestring budget.
