The existence of a new GPU cluster at the University of Vermont (DeepGreen) expected to come online in Summer 2019 necessitates a new approach for onboarding researchers across disciplines. This includes the goal of introducing new users with varying high performance computational skillsets to the instrument. The research computing facilitator will design and build a set of curricular materials that meet the needs of UVM researchers while simultaneously developing competency in various machine learning frameworks. Ultimately we hope to give researchers enough training to allow them to incorporate machine intelligence into their workflows.
