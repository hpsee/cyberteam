status: student
hpc-experience: Some, but I would like to learn more. I am interested in learning both the technical side as well as its application in the computational sciences. I have used the HPC system at the University of Rhode Island during my undergraduate for computational chemistry research while studying Biology. During my masters I used a local multi-node system for bioinformatics and GPGPU for machine learning.
