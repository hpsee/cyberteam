hpc-experience: I am a research assistant in Josh Bongardâ€™s Morphology Evolution and Computation Lab at The University of Vermont. I regularly run evolutionary robotics experiments on the Vermont Advanced Computing Core (VACC). When I first started to run these experiments I suspected that the performance of my code was limited because it was a migrated version of a desktop application and could only use cores on one node at a time. This led me to learn how to distribute the physics simulation and robot fitness evaluation across multiple nodes of the cluster using MPI. I wrote a python package which uses mpi4py to do this and I now run these experiments on multiple nodes using more than 70 cores.
